\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame containing the data whose characteristics are to be 
mimicked during the data simulation.}

\item{ties_method}{Method on how to deal with equal values 
during rank transformation. Acceptable input:"max","average","min". This
parameter is passed by \code{\link[modgo]{rbi_normal_transform}} to the 
parameter \code{ties.method} of \code{\link[base]{rank}}.}

\item{variables}{a vector of which variables you want to transform.
Default:colnames(data)}

\item{bin_variables}{a character vector listing the binary variables.}

\item{categ_variables}{a character vector listing the ordinal categorical 
variables.}

\item{n_samples}{Number of rows of each simulated data set. Default is
the number of rows of \code{data}.}

\item{sigma}{a covariance matrix of NxN (N= number of variables) 
provided by the user to bypass the covariance matrix calculations}

\item{nrep}{number of repetitions.}

\item{noise_mu}{Logical value if you want to apply noise to
multivariate mean. Default: FALSE}

\item{pertr_vec}{A named vector.Vector's names are the continuous variables
that the user want to perturb. Variance of simulated data set mimic original
data's variance.}

\item{change_cov}{change the covariance of a specific pair of variables.}

\item{change_amount}{the amount of change in  the covariance
of a specific pair of variables.}

\item{seed}{A numeric value specifying the random seed. If \code{seed = NA},
no random seed is set.}

\item{thresh_var}{A data frame that contains the thresholds(left and right)
of specified variables
(1st column: variable names, 2nd column: Left thresholds, 
3rd column: Right thresholds)}

\item{thresh_force}{A logical value indicating if you want to force threshold
in case the proportion of samples that can surpass the threshold are less 
than 10\%}

\item{var_prop}{A named vector that provides a  proportion of 
value=1 for a specific binary variable(=name of the vector) that will be
the proportion of this value in the simulated data sets.[this may increase
execution time drastically]}

\item{var_infl}{A named vector.Vector's names are the continuous variables
that the user want to perturb and increase their variance}

\item{infl_cov_stable}{Logical value. If TRUE,perturbation is applied to 
original data set and simulations values mimic the perturbed original data 
set.Covariance matrix used for simulation = original data's correlations.
If FALSE, perturbation is applied to the simulated data sets.}

\item{tol}{A numeric value that set up 
tolerance(relative to largest variance) for numerical lack of
positive-definiteness in Sigma}

\item{stop_sim}{A logical value indicating if the analysis should
stop before simulation and produce only the correlation matrix}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{SimulatedData}{A list of data frames containing the simulated data.}
\item{OriginalData}{A data frame with the input data.}
\item{Correlations}{a list of correlation matrices. The ith element is the
correlation matrix for the ith simulated dataset. The \code{(repn + 1)}th
(last) element of the list is the average of the correlation matrices.}
\item{Binary_variables}{character vector listing the binary variables}
\item{Categorical_variables}{a character vector listing the ordinal 
categorical variables}
\item{Covariance_Matrix}{Covariance matrix used when generating observations
from a multivariate normal distribution.} 
\item{Seed}{Random seed used.}
\item{Samples_Produced}{Number of rows of each simulated dataset.} 
\item{Sim_Dataset_Number}{Number of simulated datasets produced.}
