 abstract={This paper describes the use of GLDEX in R to fit distributions to empirical data using the discretized and maximum likelihood methods. The GLDEX package also provides diagnostic tests to examine the quality of fit through the resample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test, quantile plots and comparison of the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis between the empirical data and the fitted distribution.},
